    Every git call in this engine is advisory or fail-open — a missing git, a directory
    that is not a work tree, a non-zero exit all mean "unknown", never "raise". Eleven
    call sites each decided that for themselves and disagreed on the details that matter:

    - `encoding="utf-8"` is not cosmetic. With `text=True` alone Python decodes with the
      LOCALE codec, so on a Windows console (cp1252) a non-ASCII path or remote URL either
      mojibakes or raises inside a bare `except`, and the caller reads the empty result as
      "nothing found" — a check failing OPEN, silently, on one platform. Three sites had
      the encoding because someone was bitten; the other eight did not.
    - Two of them used `check_output(...).decode()`, which is the same bug with no `text=`.
    - The exception nets ranged from `Exception` to `(OSError, SubprocessError)`, so a
      `UnicodeDecodeError` was caught by some and fatal in others.

    Decoding stays strict on purpose: a path git could not hand over as UTF-8 must surface
    as None (fall back to the full, safe answer), never as a replacement character that
    silently fails to match a real file.
