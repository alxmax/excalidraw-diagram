# proposal. Re-adding it needs that ADR's bar met first, not a code review.

    stacked-conditions (warn), statement-too-long (warn), ac-count-low (warn),
    ac-count-high (warn), vague-term (warn), redundant-modal (warn). Read-only.
    Exit-neutral by default; with --strict it exits non-zero on any error-severity
    finding AND promotes structural checks (ac-count-high) to error severity.
    Requirements with `lint_exempt: [check-name]` frontmatter silently skip those checks;
    active exemptions are printed after the requirement header.
    The default run writes nothing. With `decompose` (the opt-in `--decompose` flag) each
    `statement-size` finding scaffolds one draft requirement from its clause. It covers
    that check ONLY - see the note above `cmd_lint` for why `ac-count-high` does not get
    the same treatment. The gate, the pre-commit hook and CI never pass it: `gate` runs
    the lint and the map-freshness check in one verdict, so a file written during the
    lint step would fail the freshness check of the same run (ARCH-DECOMPOSE-050).
    `only` narrows the run to one id — `clarify <ID> --decompose` promises to scaffold
    for that requirement, not for every over-long clause in the corpus. A run that
    scaffolds nothing says which findings the flag acts on: the two checks that are
    ERRORS under `--strict` are not among them, and a reader who has just been told to
    split something must not read `All clean` as agreement."""
