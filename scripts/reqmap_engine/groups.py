# ---------- decompose on contract groups: the code rung for a tagged corpus ----------
# `init` mints the code rung only for files it extracts, and it extracts only untagged
# files; `clarify --levels` classifies a requirement but never creates one. So a corpus
# that adopted the tool at the architecture rung had no path to `level: code` at all —
# on one consumer, 40 of 42 architecture nodes with zero children and 160 group labels
# sitting in their contracts. This is the path. The seam is one the AUTHOR already drew:
# a bold group label in the Description is a heading the author wrote to say "these
# clauses belong together", and a behaviour group is what the code rung is defined as.
# It is not the engine inventing structure; it is the engine reading structure that is
# already in the file, which is the line ADR-0025 had to refold 573 leaves back behind.

## Description
> Split from {parent} along a contract group the author wrote: **{label}**. Rewrite this
> quote before confirming — say what this behaviour is for and what breaks without it.

Every bullet below is binding.
{bullets}

## Cases
{cases}

## Context
**Notes**
- SCAFFOLD, NOT A DECISION. The seam was the parent's own group label, not a guess, but
  whether this group is ONE behaviour or several is still yours to judge.
- No `implements:` tag was written. The gate checks that a tag exists, never that it
  points at the right code, so an auto-generated child citing the wrong function would
  pass every check. Expected members, found by searching for the group's subject —
  verify each, then tag by hand:
{members}
- {moved} case(s) moved here from {parent}; {unassigned} stayed on the parent because no
  group's subject appeared in their text, or more than one did.
